> From [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10k9zcn/switch_from_rrtk_450_deck_to_rtk_and_rrtk_2k_deck/): "I personally did the 1250-something RRTK deck and I regret doing more than 400-600-ish. I did have fun doing it, but I (looking at my stats) only encountered the later kanji when I already knew around 4000 words. The word / kanji frequency isn't really worth it in my opinion", "I second this. I did around 1000, and really regret not stopping at around 300. I'd say finish your 450 from your current deck and then from here just learn the first 200 most common words (with kanji and pronunciation), then start mining vocabulary from immersion."

- Consume content made by Native Japanese Speakers for Native Japanese Speakers
- The best way to learn japanese is to consume content you are actually interested in. It's going to be very difficult in the beginning but start from Day 1.
- I love songs and analysing their lyrics. Study japanese lyrics of songs that I like. Try to translate japanese songs to my native language.
- More Examples: Use Netflix to rewatch shows that you love with Japanese Subtitles on or Japanese Dub turned on. Watch anime, japanese movies like those from Hayao Miyazaki. Watch japanese Youtubers
- Also, make friends and conversate with native japanese people with the same interests as you, there are many communities online (Discord) to help you with this.
