## âœ¨ Kanji 

ðŸ“š **Main Resource**

- ðŸ“‡ (Anki Deck) [Remembering the Kanji 450 with Stories](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XMS1ZgLjqLESuQkls00VYPepVT4Kfkya?usp=drive_link), [Alternative Link](https://mega.nz/file/2SJiWC4b#hL98qtC_hiLlQDg0LqVJoqD2-5ywT2Nwd4kjROY_KwQ)

> From [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10k9zcn/switch_from_rrtk_450_deck_to_rtk_and_rrtk_2k_deck/): "I personally did the 1250-something RRTK deck and I regret doing more than 400-600-ish. I did have fun doing it, but I (looking at my stats) only encountered the later kanji when I already knew around 4000 words. The word / kanji frequency isn't really worth it in my opinion", "I second this. I did around 1000, and really regret not stopping at around 300. I'd say finish your 450 from your current deck and then from here just learn the first 200 most common words (with kanji and pronunciation), then start mining vocabulary from immersion."
